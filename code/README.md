## Code for simulations
`logistic_model1_check.R` and `knn_model1_check.R` are used to produce the assessment results of strong duality and feasibility, in Figure 2.

`knn.R`, `lda.R`, `logistic.R`, and `nnb.R` are used to produce the numerical results for simulation cases 1-4 in the paper. In each code file, the corresponding function class such as kNN or LDA is considered and equipped by different NP methods and benchmarks.
